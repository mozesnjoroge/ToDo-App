# todo_list_sqflite

## Flutter sqflite personal project

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application that manages your todo tasks with sqflite database.

- A user can record their todo tasks, dueDate and description.
- The tasks can be filtered in terms of their category, update and deleted once thet are done.
- This projects helps me understand core concepts of flutter sqflite database principles.
